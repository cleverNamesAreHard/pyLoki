# pyLoki: Communication Using ICMP

## Overview
pyLoki demonstrates how ICMP packets can be utilized for communication. This repository contains two Python scripts: one for sending messages (`icmp_sender.py`) and another for listening to them (`icmp_listener.py`). This is a Python-based implementation of the Loki Project as a proof of concept.

## Features
- **ICMP Utilization:** Utilizes ICMP Echo and Echo Reply packets for covert data transfers.
- **No Encryption:** The current implementation does not include encryption of messages. This is designed purely as a proof of concept, and so encryption is not needed.
- **Selective Packet Identification:** Employs specialized identifiers to detect and process relevant ICMP packets efficiently.

## Installation
Clone the repository with the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cleverNamesAreHard/pyLoki.git
```

## Usage
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your machine before proceeding.

### Running the Listener
To operate the listener script, execute:
```bash
sudo python icmp_listener.py
```
Note: Administrative privileges may be required, especially on systems like WSL in Windows.

### Sending Messages
To dispatch a message, use the following command:
```bash
sudo python icmp_sender.py <destination_ip> "Your secret message here"
```
Note: Sending messages may also necessitate administrative privileges depending on your systemâ€™s setup.

## Detection and Mitigation
- **Detection Techniques:** Monitoring for irregular ICMP traffic patterns can help identify the use of unauthorized communication channels.
- **Prevention Strategies:** To prevent unauthorized use, consider disabling or controlling ICMP Echo traffic at your network perimeter.
